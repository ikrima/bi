# 90-Day Implementation Sprint
## From Vision to Revenue-Generating MVP

### The Brutal Reality

You have 90 days to prove this works or funding dries up. Every day matters. Every feature must deliver immediate value. This document shows exactly how to build a Player Intelligence Platform that customers will pay for by day 91.

---

## Pre-Sprint: Week 0 - Setup for Success

### Team Assembly
```
Core Team (3 people minimum):
- Full-Stack Engineer (You - the founder/lead)
- ML Engineer (Can be contractor)
- Frontend Engineer (Can be junior)

Part-Time Support:
- Designer (10 hours/week via Upwork)
- DevOps (5 hours/week via consulting)
```

### Technology Decisions (No Debates Allowed)
```python
# Backend - Boring and Bulletproof
FastAPI          # API framework - fast, simple, type-safe
PostgreSQL       # Database - with pgvector extension
Redis            # Queue and cache - simple, reliable
Docker           # Containerization - standard

# ML Pipeline - Proven Solutions
sentence-transformers  # Embeddings - no GPU needed
HDBSCAN              # Clustering - handles noise well
scikit-learn         # Basic ML - tried and true

# Frontend - Ship Fast
Next.js 14       # React framework - full-stack capable
Tailwind CSS     # Styling - no CSS debates
Recharts         # Charts - simple and sufficient
Vercel           # Deployment - zero DevOps initially

# Infrastructure - Start Cheap
Heroku           # Backend hosting - $50/month to start
Supabase         # Managed PostgreSQL - $25/month
Vercel           # Frontend hosting - Free tier
OpenAI API       # Fallback for embeddings - pay as you go
```

### Design Patterns (Copy These)
- Authentication: Clerk.dev (don't build your own)
- Payments: Stripe Checkout (pre-built flow)
- Email: Resend (simple API)
- Monitoring: Sentry (free tier)
- Analytics: PostHog (generous free tier)

## Sprint 1: Days 1-30 - The Pipeline

### Week 1: Discord Data Flowing
```python
# Day 1-2: Discord OAuth
- Use discord.py library
- Store tokens securely
- Handle rate limits properly

# Day 3-4: Message Ingestion
@app.post("/webhook/discord")
async def ingest_message(message: DiscordMessage):
    # Store raw message
    await db.messages.insert(message)
    # Queue for processing
    await redis.enqueue('process_message', message.id)
    return {"status": "queued"}

# Day 5-7: Basic Processing Worker
def process_message(message_id: str):
    message = db.messages.get(message_id)
    # Generate embedding
    embedding = model.encode(message.content)
    # Store in pgvector
    db.embeddings.insert(message_id, embedding)
```

        min_samples=5,
        metric='euclidean'
    )
    labels = clusterer.fit_predict(embeddings)
    return labels

# Day 11-12: Theme Extraction
def extract_themes(cluster_messages):
    # Use TF-IDF to find representative words
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=10)
    vectorizer.fit(cluster_messages)
    return vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Day 13-14: Sentiment Analysis
from transformers import pipeline

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
      <MetricCard title="Active Themes" value={clusters.length} />
      <MetricCard title="Sentiment" value={sentiment.score} />
      <ThemesList themes={clusters} />
      <SentimentChart data={sentiment.history} />
    </div>
  )
}

// Day 18-19: Real-time Updates
// Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
const EventSource = new EventSource('/api/events')
EventSource.onmessage = (event) => {

        issues=issues,
        sentiment=sentiment
    )

## The Brutal Truths

### What Will Actually Happen
- Week 2: Discord API will break something
- Week 4: First customer will hate the UI
- Week 6: Clustering will produce garbage for someone
- Week 8: You'll want to rebuild everything
- Week 10: A competitor will launch
- Week 12: You'll be exhausted

### How to Survive
1. **Ship daily** - Momentum matters more than perfection
2. **Talk to users** - Every day, without exception
3. **Ignore competitors** - They're probably struggling too
4. **Automate everything** - Your time is the scarcest resource
5. **Charge immediately** - Free users will waste your time
6. **Focus on one metric** - Time saved per week
7. **Say no constantly** - Feature requests will kill you

## The Final Word

This plan is brutally pragmatic because that's what it takes. You're not building the perfect system - you're building something that delivers value TODAY and can evolve into the vision TOMORROW.

Every feature is chosen for immediate impact. Every technical decision optimizes for shipping speed. Every process is designed to get customer feedback faster.

In 90 days, you'll have:
- A working product
- Paying customers  
- Validated problem-solution fit
- A foundation to build the full vision

That's not the end goal - it's the beginning. But it's a beginning with revenue, customers, and momentum.

Now stop reading and start building. Day 1 starts now.
