# Demo Day Pitch - Player Intelligence

## The 2-Minute Version

---

### Slide 1: The Problem (15 seconds)
# "Game developers spend 20 hours a week reading Discord"

*[Show overwhelming Discord screenshot]*

They're drowning in feedback. Missing critical issues. Making million-dollar decisions based on the loudest 1%.

---

### Slide 2: The Solution (20 seconds)
# "We read it for them"

*[Show actual email digest]*

Every morning at 8 AM, they get one email with everything that matters:
- What players are upset about
- What they love
- What needs immediate attention

That's it. 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.

**"What do you do?"**
> "We're Palantir for game developers. AI reads their Discord and tells them what matters."

> "Sentiment analysis tells you players are unhappy. We tell you why, who, and what to do about it."

**"What's your moat?"**
> "Every query makes us smarter about that specific game. After 1000 queries, we're irreplaceable."

**"Why will you win?"**
> "We're already winning. 50% weekly growth, 90% margins, customers love us."

**"What's the biggest risk?"**
> "Scaling fast enough. We're turning away customers."

**"Why games?"**

## Demo Day Hacks

### What to Wear
- Black t-shirt or simple button-down
- No logos, no distractions
- Look forgettable, make product memorable

### How to Present
- No "um" or "uh" - pause instead
- Point at the graph when showing growth
- Make eye contact with back row (projects confidence)
- End strong: "We're Player Intelligence. We're hiring."

### The Graph That Matters
Make it huge. Make it green. Make it go up and to the right.

### Practice Schedule
- 50 runs minimum
- Record yourself 10 times
- Present to non-technical friend (if they get it, VCs will)
- Time it: 1:55 max (leave buffer)

## The Backup Slides (Have Ready, Don't Show)

1. **Technical Architecture** (they won't care but might ask)
2. **Customer Testimonials** (3 quotes, real names)
3. **Competitive Analysis** (we win on focus)
4. **18-Month Roadmap** (predictive → prescriptive → autonomous)
5. **Team Backgrounds** (LinkedIns + credibility)

---

## Remember

You're not selling AI. You're not selling technology.

You're selling **time**.

Every game developer wants 10 hours back per week. You give it to them for $499/month.

That's the entire business. Everything else is commentary.
