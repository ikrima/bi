# ðŸš€ Launch Your MVP in 30 Minutes

Stop reading. Start shipping. Here's exactly how to get this live.

## Prerequisites (5 minutes)

```bash
# You need:
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- A Discord server you admin
- A Gmail account (for sending emails)
```

## Step 1: Discord Bot Setup (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application" â†’ Name it "PlayerIntel"
3. Go to "Bot" section â†’ Click "Add Bot"
4. Copy the token (you'll need this)
5. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents" enable:
   - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
   - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
6. Go to OAuth2 â†’ URL Generator:
   - Scopes: Select "bot"
   - Bot Permissions: Select "Read Messages/View Channels" and "Read Message History"
7. Copy the generated URL and open it to add bot to your server

## Step 2: Gmail App Password (3 minutes)

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-factor authentication (if not already)
3. Search for "App passwords"
4. Generate new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password

## Step 3: Backend Setup (10 minutes)

```bash
# Clone or create directory
mkdir player-intelligence
cd player-intelligence

# Create the main.py file (copy from artifact above)
# Create requirements.txt:
cat > requirements.txt << EOF
discord.py==2.3.2
sentence-transformers==2.2.2
scikit-learn==1.3.2
numpy==1.24.3
schedule==1.2.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
EOF

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (this takes 2-3 minutes)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id-here
EMAIL_FROM=digest@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_TO=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password-here
EOF

# Test run
python main.py
```

## Step 4: Dashboard Setup (7 minutes)

```bash
# In a new terminal
npx create-next-app@latest dashboard --typescript --tailwind --app
cd dashboard

# Replace app/page.tsx with the code from artifact above

# Install additional dependencies
npm install recharts

# Create app/globals.css (if not exists)
cat > app/globals.css << EOF
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
EOF

# Run the dashboard
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Step 5: Deploy to Production (10 minutes)

### Backend Deployment (Heroku - Free tier works)

```bash
# In the backend directory
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token
heroku config:set DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id
# ... set all other env variables

# Create Procfile
echo "worker: python main.py" > Procfile

# Deploy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Launch"
git push heroku main

# Scale the worker
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

### Dashboard Deployment (Vercel - Free)

```bash
# In the dashboard directory
npm install -g vercel
vercel

# Follow prompts, accept all defaults
# Your dashboard is now live at https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Step 6: Schedule Daily Digest (2 minutes)

Edit `main.py` and uncomment the scheduler section:

```python
# Change this:
asyncio.run(pi.run_daily_digest())

# To this:
schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(lambda: asyncio.run(pi.run_daily_digest()))
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

Redeploy to Heroku:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enable daily schedule"
git push heroku main
```

## You're Live! ðŸŽ‰

Total time: ~30 minutes

What you now have:
- âœ… Discord bot reading messages
- âœ… Daily email digest at 8 AM
- âœ… Web dashboard showing insights
- âœ… Everything deployed and running

## First Customer Checklist

1. **Add to their Discord** (2 minutes)
   - Send them your bot invite link
   - Have them add it to their server
   - Get their channel ID

2. **Configure their digest** (1 minute)
   - Add their email to EMAIL_TO
   - Set their DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID
   - Redeploy

3. **Send test digest** (1 minute)
   ```bash
   heroku run python main.py
   ```

4. **Charge them money** (1 minute)
   - Send Stripe payment link
   - $499/month
   - No free trials

## Quick Fixes for Common Issues

**"Model download is slow"**
- First run downloads 90MB model. Only happens once.

**"No messages found"**
- Check bot has permission to read channel
- Check channel ID is correct
- Try increasing the limit in fetch_messages()

**"Email not sending"**
- Check Gmail app password (not your regular password)
- Check 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- Try smtp.sendgrid.net if Gmail blocks you

**"Dashboard shows mock data"**
- That's intentional for MVP
- Implement /api/digest endpoint when you have 10 customers

## Next Steps (After First Customer Pays)

Week 1 Priority:
```python
# Add to main.py:
- Multiple Discord servers support
- Better clustering (use HDBSCAN)
- Store digests in PostgreSQL
- Add Stripe webhook for payments
```

Week 2 Priority:
```javascript
// Add to dashboard:
- Real data from API
- User authentication (Clerk)
- Customer settings page
- Export to PDF feature
```

Week 3 Priority:
```python
# Add intelligence:
- Persona discovery
- Trend detection
- Webhook for real-time alerts
- Slack integration
```

## The Paul Graham Test

Ask yourself every morning:
1. Did we talk to users yesterday? (You better have)
2. Did we ship code yesterday? (You better have)
3. Are we default alive? (Check your math)

## Stop Reading. Start Shipping.

Your competition is reading documentation.
You're getting customers.

First customer by Friday or you're doing it wrong.

**Remember**: This MVP is embarrassing. That's the point. Ship it anyway.

**Remember**: Code quality doesn't matter if no one uses it.

**Remember**: You can refactor after you have revenue.

Now go. Launch. Today.
